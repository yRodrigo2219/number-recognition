<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Number Recognition Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://yrodrigo2219.github.io/number-recognition/)

The project was made with the intention of learning more about the basics of Neural Networks, getting a grip of what it's all about, and how slow is the training process. The training part of the project was made by following [Michael Nielsen's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) and helped me practice my python skills (and improve my python knowledge).

The interactive part of the project was not included in the book, and it was made with its input being a JSON object, in that way, you can train the network in any language and exhibit it here.

### Built With

This project is built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML. And the Neural Network training script was made using Python and Numpy.

- Training made by following [Michael Nielsen's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This project is not meant to be installed locally, but you can check the [Live version](https://yrodrigo2219.github.io/number-recognition/).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

[![Number Recognition Screenshot][product-exemple]](https://yrodrigo2219.github.io/number-recognition/)

- The digit at the top, right after "It's a:" is the Neural Network guess
- The canvas in pink is the place where you need to draw the digit
- The canvas in white at the bottom is what the Neural Network sees

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

Find a better method to train the Neural Networks in JavaScript, right now is too slow.
